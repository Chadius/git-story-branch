# git-story-branch

So you've got a branch, and it's in support of a particular user story, so you put your story id at the end of your branch name.

With the power of `git-story-branch`, this allows you to:

1. Open the story for the current branch in your browser
2. Delete old branches for stories that have already been accepted
3. ~~Automatically unsubscribe from unwanted spam emails~~
4. ~~Be reminded if you haven't watered your plants recently~~

At least, it will, some day.
